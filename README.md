# funicular-bank
An online banking application used as part of my graduate work at BYU.

## Funicular?

We have a long-running inside joke about buying a railroad in our research lab.  A funicular is a type of inclined cable-railway, and it just so happens that "funicular" was one of the words that Github suggested to me when I created the repository.  How could I pass that one up, eh?

## Are you FDIC insured?

No, this isn't a real bank.  This application was intended only to be used as part of a series of authentication usability tests being conducted by the [Internet Security Research Lab](https://isrl.byu.edu) at Brigham Young University.  We're not a real bank (and besides, our interest rates are lousy).
